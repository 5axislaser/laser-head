# laser-head
Drawings and files for building the 5 axis laser cutter head.

The STL-files are meant for 3D-printing. 
The sketchup file is Sketchup Make 2017. Sketchup can be downloaded here: https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions

Alternatively the files can be imported in other CAD-programs, eg Fusion 360

For our version of the laser head, we have used SLS-prints.
